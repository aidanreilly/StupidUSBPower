Update the design with the following simple modifications:

* Female USB header to allow the board to be more easily powered, eg., with a standard USB cable, from the wall.
* Add a very simple LFO for testing CV inputs
* Allow for easy multimeter probe points to accurately measure current. Perhaps only on one of the power headers. Use jumpers to open the 12, -12, lines (?).
* add backward power protection or fuses to protect the USB supply from silly breadboard short circuits, reverse polarity mistakes, etc.
